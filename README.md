# WeatherForecast App with OpenWeatherMap API

Here, I have created an app in Python using a popular framework Django. This project is just for fun. 
Take a look around and give your opinions. This app provides weather forecast for next 5 days. The API provides the weather data for every 3 hour but I have printed the data for 9:00 AM everyday. 

It does not take user input so while running the django python server if you want to change the city then you will need to enter it manually in the code, save it and refresh the page. It should provide the data for the intended city. 
```python
city = 'Ahmedabad'
#change the variable name to intended city to get the desired output, in views.py
# For Ex. change it to New York or Las Vegas or Mumbai
```
